## ✅ **Changes Made**

### **1. Documentation Organization**
- ✅ All markdown files moved to `docs/`
- ✅ Organized into subdirectories:
  - `architecture/` - System architecture documentation
  - `guides/` - User guides and tutorials
  - `status/` - Status reports and summaries
- ✅ Main `README.md` stays in root

### **2. Requirements Consolidation**
- ✅ All requirements files moved to `requirements/`
- ✅ Renamed for clarity:
  - `requirements.txt` → `requirements/base.txt`
  - `requirements-api.txt` → `requirements/api.txt`
- ✅ Added `requirements/README.md` for guidance

### **3. Scripts Organization**
- ✅ Scripts remain in `scripts/` (flat structure)
- ✅ Easy to import and run
- ✅ No changes needed

### **4. Config Files**
- ✅ Already organized in `configs/`
- ✅ No changes needed

## 📦 **File Locations**

### **Documentation**
| Type | Location |
|------|----------|
| Main README | `README.md` (root) |
| Architecture | `docs/architecture/` |
| Guides | `docs/guides/` |
| Status | `docs/status/` |

### **Requirements**
| File | Location |
|------|----------|
| Base | `requirements/base.txt` |
| API | `requirements/api.txt` |

### **Code Modules**
| Module | Location |
|--------|----------|
| Models | `models/` |
| Preprocessing | `preprocessing/` |
| Training | `training/` |
| Decoding | `decoding/` |
| Database | `database/` |
| NLP | `nlp/` |
| Utils | `utils/` |

## 🔄 **Migration Notes**

### **Requirements Installation**
```bash
# Old way (still works):
pip install -r requirements/base.txt

# New way (same):
pip install -r requirements/base.txt
```

### **Documentation Access**
- **Before**: Files scattered in root
- **After**: Organized in `docs/` subdirectories
- **Main README**: Still in root for easy access

### **Import Paths**
- ✅ No changes needed - code imports unchanged
- ✅ Scripts still in `scripts/` (flat structure)
- ✅ All Python modules in same locations

---

## ✅ **Benefits**

1. **Cleaner Root** - Only essential files in root
2. **Better Organization** - Related files grouped together
3. **Easier Navigation** - Clear folder structure
4. **Professional** - Industry-standard organization
5. **Maintainable** - Easier to find and update files

---

## 📝 **Quick Reference**

### **Find Documentation**
- Architecture docs: `docs/architecture/`
- User guides: `docs/guides/`
- Status reports: `docs/status/`

### **Install Requirements**
```bash
pip install -r requirements/base.txt      # Core
pip install -r requirements/api.txt      # API features
```

### **Run Scripts**
```bash
# Scripts remain in scripts/
python scripts/prepare_data.py
python scripts/build_lm.py
python scripts/benchmark.py
```
